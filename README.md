You're tasked with creating a feature that allows sellers to edit their shop name, on https://ribblr.com/myshop using HTML, PHP and jQuery. Write a code snippet demonstrating how you would achieve this functionality, ensuring that name is updated dynamically (without reloading the page) on the front end and back end. Please include updating a MySql table called shop_name on the backend. Make sure to check the name, entered by the user, for validity in both Jquery and PHP including special characters etc.
